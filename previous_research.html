								There are two major research areas I have been interested in:

										<li><b>Theoretical Physics</b>
										(including cosmology, astrophysics, and quantum physics): with the goal to learn more about the laws of physics that govern our Universe. </li>
										<li><b>Control Theory</b>
										(including non-linear control theory, safety-critical systems, and robotics):
										with the goal to control and/or mimic phenomena that exists in nature. </li>
								</ul>
							On this route, I have extensively used programming and simulations
								(e.g. Python (including TensorFlow), MATLAB/Simulink, and Lumiercal)
								as well as statistical tools, such as machine learning.

							<p> I was in charge of developing a statistical software package in Python for
							analyzing spectral content of X-ray light curves. This include summary statistics such as <i>power spectrum</i> and
							<i>root mean squared variability</i> for single light curves and <i>coherence</i>, <i>covariance</i>, and
							<i>time lag</i> for two simultaneous light curves in different energy bands.

								<blockquote><span class="image right"><img src="images/pic01.jpg" alt="" /></span>
								"Black hole X-ray binaries are systems
								wherein a normal star orbits a black hole. Many of these systems have
								extended quiescent periods, wherein their X-ray luminosity hardly exceeds
								that of our Sun. However, when the black hole actively accretes from the
								atmosphere of the companion star, the X-ray luminosity can jump upward by
								eight orders of magnitude. Then, the X-ray emission from hot gas orbiting
								close to the black hole can be used to study the hole itself."

								<!-- Emission lines
								produced in this region are shaped by relativistic Doppler effects, shifting
								light to higher and lower energy, and by gravitational
								red-shifts (photons lose energy just escaping from the extreme gravitational potential).

								<p><b>What properties do black holes have and how do we learn more about them?</b>
								<a href=https://heasarc.gsfc.nasa.gov/docs/nicer/science_nuggets/20180615.html >NASA explains</a>:
								<blockquote>
								"Astrophysical black holes
								have only two properties: mass, and spin. Masses can be measured using Kepler's laws of orbital motion.
								But, how can the spin of a black hole be measured? General Relativity has provided a means:
								the spin of a black hole determines how closely matter can orbit before inevitably falling
								into the hole. Therefore, dynamical information imprinted on gas in the innermost orbits can
								be used to measure the spin. Gas in these regions is so hot that it emits in X-rays. The
								last two ionization states of iron (where 24/26 and 25/26 electrons have been stripped) can
								survive even in extremely hot gas, and X-ray emission lines (6.70 keV and 6.97 keV) tied to
								these states bear the imprints of relativistic Doppler shifts and gravitational red-shifts."

								<b> Abstract: </b> This thesis aims at using novel machine learning techniques to test the dynamics
								of the Universe via the cosmological redshift-distance test. Currently, one of the most outstanding
								questions in cosmology is the physical cause of the accelerating cosmic expansion observed with supernovae.
								Simultaneously, tensions in measurements of the Hubble expansion parameter $H_0$ are emerging. Measuring
								the Universe expansion with next generation galaxy imaging surveys, such as provided by the Vera Rubin Observatory,
								offers the opportunity to discover new physics governing the Universe dynamics. In this thesis, with the
								long-term goal to unravel these peculiarities, we create a deep generative model in the form of a convolutional
								variational auto-encoder (VAE), trained with a "Variational Mixture of Posteriors" prior (VampPrior) and
								high-resolution galaxy images from the simulation project <i>TNG-50</i>. Our model is able to learn a
								prior on the visual features of galaxies and can generate synthetic galaxy images which preserve the
								coarse features (shape, size, inclination, and surface brightness profile), but not finer morphological
								features, such as spiral arms. The generative model for galaxy images is applicable to uses outside the
								scope of this thesis and is thus a contribution in itself. We next implement a cosmological pinhole
								camera model, taking angular diameter changes with redshift into account, to forward simulate the
								actual observation on a telescope detector. Building upon the hypothesis that certain features of
								galaxies should be of proper physical sizes, we use probabilistic triangulation to find the
								comoving distance $r(z,\Omega)$ to these in a flat ($K=0$) Universe. Using a sample of high-resolution
								galaxy images from redshifts $z\in[0.05,0.5]$ from \texttt{TNG-50}, we demonstrate that the implemented
								Bayesian inference approach successfully estimates $r(z)$ within $1\sigma$-error
								($\Delta r_{\text{est}} = 140$ $(580)$ Mpc for $z=0.05$ $(0.5)$). Including the surface brightness
								attenuation and utilizing the avalanche of upcoming galaxy images could significantly lower the uncertainties.
								This thesis thus shows a promising path forward utilizing novel machine learning techniques and massive next-generation
								imaging data to improve and generalize the traditional cosmological angular-diameter test, which in turn has the
								potential to increase our understanding of the Universe.

							The last few years have seen a concerted research effort
							in autonomous systems, with the goal of integrating these
							systems into everyday life. As a result, safety guarantees
							that the system always satisfies certain state constraints is of
							critical importance in the design of such systems. The notion
							of set invariance has emerged as a theoretical foundation
							for safety of dynamical systems. Finding control-invariant sets is, however,
							challenging for high-dimensional nonlinear systems,
							but is possible for some systems via analytical techniques. In [1] we show how to characterize
							invariant sets for integrator systems, and utilize differential flatness to apply the results
							in UAV collision avoidance. An example is shown in the videos above, where a drone is equipped/not equipped
							(left/right) with an invariance-based safety filter. <br>

								<b>Abstract:</b> Ensuring safety through set invariance has proven a useful
								method in a variety of applications in robotics and control. However,
								finding analytical expressions for maximal invariant sets, so as to maximize
								the operational freedom of the system without compromising safety, is notoriously
								difficult for high-dimensional systems with input constraints. Here we present a
								generic method for characterizing invariant sets of nth-order integrator systems,
								based on analyzing roots of univariate polynomials. Additionally, we obtain analytical
								expressions for the orders $n\leq 4$. Using differential flatness we subsequently leverage
								the results for the $n=4$ case to the problem of obstacle avoidance for quadrotor UAVs.
								The resulting controller has a light computational footprint that showcases the power of
								finding analytical expressions for control-invariant sets.

						  Because of its stability and scalability, quantum photonics is destined to have a central role in future technologies.
							There are already existing photonic quantum circuits on silicon chips, and quantum
							logic gates have been achieved with high fidelity by fabricating silica-on-silicon waveguide
							quantum circuits. The fact that quantum mechanical behavior is built into the system also
							means that photonic circuits can be used as a non-general quantum computer to simulate
							larger quantum systems which can be extremely memory consuming on conventional computers.
							By hard-coding a quantum problem onto a photonic chip, complex simulations such
							as boson sampling can be achieved by simply observing how the system evolves.
							In this work [1], the coupling efficiency from an on-chip single-photon source,
							approximated by a dipole, into a waveguide has been simulated in different geometrical configurations.<br>

								<b>Abstract:</b> Recent technological advances have made it possible to miniaturize and integrate
								optical components in quantum circuits. The connection between different components is enabled by
								waveguides, which support the propagation of the information carrier, a single-photon. A prerequisite
								for functioning quantum photonic chips is the efficient coupling of non-classical light into the circuit.
								In this work, this coupling efficiency from an on-chip single-photon source, approximated by a dipole, into
								a waveguide has been simulated. The high refractive index material silicon nitride Si3N4 has been used as
								a strip waveguide, placed on top of a silicon oxide SiO2 wafer with surrounding air. To solve Maxwell’s
								equations in the structures, the finite difference time-domain (FDTD) method has been used through software
								by Lumerical. It is shown that for the light spectrum with wavelengths 750 to 800 nm a waveguide with cross
								section dimensions 600x250 nm supports the fundamental transversal electric (TE) and transversal magnetic (TM)
								modes. The coupling efficiency is shown to reach 7 % in each direction when the dipole is placed on top of
								the waveguide. Having the dipole on in front of the waveguide, however, results in over 50 % coupling in the
								forward direction. Additionally, it is shown that in-plane 2D-material single-photon emitters, approximated
								by in-plane dipoles, give better results than out-of-plane dipoles for most of the tested configurations.
								In conclusion, these results present evidence for a substantially higher coupling efficiency from 2D-material
								quantum dots than have been achieved in experiments.
